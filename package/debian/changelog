    7-bit code extensions now remain escape sequences, which become accelerator keys.

    * console-terminal emulator now supports "application mode" for the calculator keypad and cursor keypad, and sends both application and normal mode control sequences for these keypads as commanded.

  * The user-services@ service bundles now use fifo-listen and create the per-user-manager/ subdirectory.
  * The JAVA_HOME mechanism in the conversion subsystem is now unused by any service bundle.
  * setup-machine-id now writes /usr/local/etc/machine-id on FreeBSD/TrueOS systems.

  * There is now a Packages and Ports chapter in the Guide.
  * static-networking configuration import now handles ipv6_cpe_wanif and ipv6_activate_all_interfaces.

  * More BSD services: sysvipc
  * The user virtual terminal multiplexor and terminal emulator services now run under the aegides of their own dedicated user accounts, rather than daemon.

  * The compatibility shutdown command now sports a new -c/--powercycle option.
  * The compatibility reboot, halt, and poweroff commands now sport a new -c/--powercycle option, for the benefits of cruel system administrators.
  * There is a new compatibility fastpowercycle/powercycle command, with all of the same options for cruel system administrators.
  * system-manager now treats SIGWINCH differently on non-Linux operating systems, treading it as a request to invoke a new powercycle service.
    SIGRTMIN+6, unused in the systemd system, is the Linux equivalent.
  * system-manager now treats SIGRTMIN+16 as the underlying actual powercycle request, which it translates to either RB_POWERCYCLE if it is present in the C library headers, or RB_AUTOBOOT if it is not.
  * There is now a new system-control powercycle subcommand, which defaults to sending SIGWINCH/SIGRTMIN+6 or SIGRTMIN+16.
  * The system-control init subcommand now sports a new c/C argument, by analogy to h/H.
    This is of course thus reflected automatically in the compatibility telinit command and the initctl-read server.
  * There is now a login-update-utmpx command.
  * There is now a freebsd-shims package, which is not installed on FreeBSD.
  * The linux-utmp service has been removed, as it is redundant with the utx service.

    dbus-broker is not in fact a functional Desktop Bus subsystem right now.
    Its developers have strongly tied it to an internal systemd mechanism.
  * More Linux services: sysstat
  * More common services: elasticsearch
  * The Guide now has a chapter on how networking is handled.

  * The leaky BSD C library and GNU C library environment variable handling is no longer used.
  * set-dynamic-hostname no longer erroneously thinks that the hostname has already been set on FreeBSD.

  * Now that systemd has an option for disabling the Nagle algorithm for TCP sockets, convert-systemd-units looks for a NoDelay= option not a Nagle= option as it used to.
