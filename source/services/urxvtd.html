<h1>
The <code>urxvtd</code> service
</h1>

<p>
As part of setting up user configuration, <a href="../external-formats.html">for every "real-person" user the external formats import subsystem generates a user-level service bundle</a> that runs <code>urxvtd</code>, the d&aelig;mon that displays terminal emulations on X displays in response to <code>urxvtc</code>.
</p>

<p>
This d&aelig;mon is set up to run <a href="../local-reaper.html"><code>local-reaper</code></a> to mark itself as a "local reaper" program.
This is possible because <code>urxvtd</code> is happy to handle reaping orphaned child processes that it did not fork itself.
</p>

<p>
This is done purely in order to make the process tree look better to users running <code>ps&nbsp;-a&nbsp;-x&nbsp;-d</code> or similar.
</p>

<p>
The visible consequences of this are that programs that are run from within urxvt terminal sessions that fork-and-exit-parent (for whatever reason) are reparented in the process tree to have the urxvtd as their parent.
Without this "local reaper" setting, they would be reparented to the per-user <a href="../service-manager.html"><code>service-manager</code></a> instance that spawned the urxvtd d&aelig;mon, making them appear as if they were also service processes.
