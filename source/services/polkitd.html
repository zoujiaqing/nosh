The PolicyKit service
</h1>

<p>
The PolicyKit program has some bugs that you may encounter.
<p>

<p>
The <code>polkitd</code> program itself switches to an unprivileged user.
Then it tries to read <code>/usr/local/share/polkit-1/rules.d/</code>, <code>/usr/local/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/</code>, and <code>/var/run/ConsoleKit/</code>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes <code>/usr/local/share/polkit-1/rules.d/</code> is installed owned by the superuser with <code>rwx------</code> permissions, and so not accessible to the unprivileged user.
Sometimes <code>/usr/local/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/</code> is installed owned by the superuser with <code>rwx------</code> permissions, and so not accessible to the unprivileged user.
Sometimes <code>/usr/local/etc/polkit-1/</code> is installed owned by the superuser with <code>rwxr-x---</code> permissions, and so not accessible to the unprivileged user.
Sometimes the ConsoleKit service is simply not running.
</p>

<p>
The <code>polkitd</code> program's failure mode in such scenarios is to keep trying, incessantly, to access these, every few seconds.
This is visible as the d&aelig;mon constantly consuming (some) CPU time and continually appearing in the listings of <code>top&nbsp;-I</code> and suchlike.
<p>

<p>
The fix for the cases of <code>/usr/local/share/polkit-1/rules.d/</code>, <code>/usr/local/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/</code>, and <code>/usr/local/etc/polkit-1/</code> is to grant the unprivileged user read and execute access to them.
The fix for the case of <code>/var/run/ConsoleKit/</code> is either to create it by hand or to run the ConsoleKit service (whose service bundle creates it as a "runtime directory" for the service, removing it when the service is shut down).
