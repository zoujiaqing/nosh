Mounting filesystems
</h1>

<p>
Volumes are mounted at bootstrap time through services like the "mount@-usr" service.
When enabled, these services are wanted by the "local-fs" target, so that default volumes are all mounted by activating that target.
</p>

<p>
In their turn they depend from services like the "fsck@-usr" service, which run <code>fsck</code> on the relevant volume before the mount service attempts to mount it.
The "fsck@-usr" service orders itself before the "mount@-usr" service.
</p>

<p>
Note that the "fsck@" service declares itself as wanted by the "mount@" service, rather than the "mount@" service declaring itself as always wanting the "fsck@" service.
This allows the "fsck@" service to be optional, and for boot-time filesystem checking to be structured in another manner should that be desired.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, services like "gbde@-usr" and "geli@-usr" run GBDE and GELI on the relevant volume before both the mount service attempts to mount it and the fsck service attempts to check it.
</p>

<p>
Often, all of these are created by <a href="fstab.html">importing the <code>/etc/fstab</code> table</a> and converting it into native service bundles.
</p>
