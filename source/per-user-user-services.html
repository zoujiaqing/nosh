Per-user user services
</h1>

<p>
In addition to setting up <a href="per-user-system-services.html">system-level services for each user</a> the configuration import subsystem sets up a whole load of service bundles for each user, to be managed by that user's personal instance of <a href="commands/service-manager.xml"><code>service-manager</code></a>.
These service bundles live in <a href="gazetteer.html#user-service-bundles">the user's service bundles directory</a> in the user's home directory.
</p>

<h2 id="types">
The types of services
</h2>

<p>
The services fall into one of three main groups: logging, non-Desktop Bus, and Desktop Bus.
</p>

<h3 id="logging">
Logging services
</h3>

<p>
There are three major logging services.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>simple-servers-log</code></dt>
<dd>
This takes the log outputs of most non-Desktop Bus non-socket servers, and writes it to <code>/var/log/user/</code><i>username</i><code>/simple-servers/</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>socket-servers-log</code></dt>
<dd>
This takes the log outputs of most non-Desktop Bus socket servers, and writes it to <code>/var/log/user/</code><i>username</i><code>/socket-servers/</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>dbus-servers-log</code></dt>
<dd>
This takes the log outputs of most Desktop Bus servers, and writes it to <code>/var/log/user/</code><i>username</i><code>/dbus-servers/</code>.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3 id="non-dbus">
Non-Desktop Bus services
</h3>

<p>
Non-Desktop Bus services are either straightforward simple services or services that listen on sockets.
They do not require the per-user Desktop Bus broker to be running.
Examples are:
</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>emacs</code></dt>
<dd>
The emacs d&aelig;mon (<code>--fg-daemon</code> mode only).
</dd>
<dt><code>urxvt</code></dt>
<dd>
The <code>urxvtd</code> d&aelig;mon.
</dd>
<dt><code>gpg-agent</code></dt>
<dd>
The GPG Agent, listening on <code>/run/user/</code><i>username</i><code>/gnupg/S.gpg-agent</code>.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
These services are not set up with a <code>DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3 id="dbus">
Desktop Bus services
</h3>

<p>
Desktop Bus services require the per-user Desktop Bus broker to be running.
This can either be running as the system-level <code>user-dbus-daemon@</code><i>username</i> service or as a user-level <code>dbus-daemon</code> service.
The latter requires that the full per-user service manager be running; and cannot be used until the per-user service manager is started.
</p>

<p>
They also need to know how to talk to it.
So the configuration import subsystem chain loads them from the <a href="commands/userenv.xml"><code>userenv</code></a> program with the <code>--set-dbus</code> option, setting an environment variable that gives the address (in <code>path=</code> form because no-one understands the <code>runtime=</code> form yet) of the <a href="gazetteer.html#user-bus-socket"><code>/run/user/</code><i>name</i><code>/bus</code></a> socket.
</p>

<p>
By convention, a Desktop Bus service is named by a common name by which users refer to it directly (such as <code>gnome-terminal-server</code>), and has an alias pointing to it from its formal Desktop Bus "server" name (such as <code>org.gnome.Terminal</code>).
The alias is used by the Desktop Bus broker when <a href="per-user-dbus-demand-start.html">demand-starting the service</a>, because the Desktop Bus broker only knows the formal names of services.
</p>

<h2 id="environment">
Environment variables
</h2>

<p>
Processes run under per-user service management execute in a d&aelig;mon-style context.
They don't have controlling terminals, and (initially) they only have the environment variables set up by the <code>user-services@</code><i>username</i> service itself, which just runs <a href="commands/userenv.xml"><code>userenv</code></a>.
In particular:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
They <em>do not have</em> the environment variables that are set up in the users' rc/profile/login scripts for shells.
Shells, and thus their rc script mechanisms, are not involved in the running of the per-user service manager instance.
</p></li>
<li><p>
They <em>do not have</em> the environment variables that are set up via the login class records in the users' <code>~/.login_conf</code> and the <code>/etc/login.conf</code> databases.
Per-user service management does not, conceptually, run within a login session.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Every user-level service is afforded an environment directory in its service definition, in the conventional location that is accessble via the likes of <code>system-control --user print-service-env org.example.Sheila</code>.
Environment variable for services should be configured there.
</p>

<h3 id="faulty-programs">
Faulty programs that require login session environment variables in their d&aelig;mon mode
</h3>

<p>
It is the wrong thing to do to explicitly set up per-user services with <code>TTY</code> or <code>DISPLAY</code> environment variables, and this is the sign of a faulty service program.
Service programs serve a single user that can be logged in multiple times in multiple forms of login session.
They should not require terminal access, and should be capable of connecting to multiple X displays simultaneously and not need an X display in order to start up.
</p>

<p>
Programs that are known to get this wrong include GNOME Terminal, KDE Notify, GNOME Weather, GNOME Maps, and MATE Notification.
These fail to work if they are not given a <code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable in order to start up in their initial not-a-client-of-any-displays-yet state, where no D-BUS clients have connected to tell them about X displays to make windows on.  
This is accounted for in the configuration import subsystem, which sets up a <code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable for each user's </code>gnome-terminal-server</code>, <code>knotify</code>, <code>org.gnome.Weather.Application</code>, <code>org.gnome.Maps</code> and <code>mate-notification-daemon</code> service.  
It just sets up <code>DISPLAY</code> as <code>:0</code> for the service.  
You might need to tweak this for unusual X setups.
