<h2>
Virtual terminals
</h2>

<p>
The most commonly employed terminal nowadays is a virtual (as opposed to real) terminal.
</p>

<p>
Using the tools in the toolset one can set up services that handle TUI login on virtual terminals, and that provide virtual terminals entirely within application mode code, supplementing or even replacing the virtual terminals provided by a Linux or BSD operating system kernel.
</p>

<p>
To log on over virtual terminals, kernel or user-space,
<a href="virtual-terminal-login.html">one sets up <code>ttylogin</code> services</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="kernel-virtual-terminals.html">To use kernel virtual terminals one arranges for such services to be enabled and (demand-)started.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="user-virtual-terminals.html">Setting up user-space virtual terminals involves similar services, additional <code>console-terminal-emulator</code> services, and realizers.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="terminal-resources.html">Terminals need various resources</a>, some of which are supplied with the toolset.
</p>

<h2>
Real terminals
</h2>

<p>
Using the tools in the toolset one can set up services that handle TUI login on real terminals.
</p>

<p>
To log on over real terminals
<a href="real-terminal-login.html">one sets up <code>ttylogin</code> services</a>.
