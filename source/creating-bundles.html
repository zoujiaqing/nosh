Creating bundles
</h1>

<p>
If you are unlucky enough to have a package that does not supply service bundle directories for its services, you have some options.
</p>

<h2 id="collections">
You can build a bundle using parts from some public <code>run</code> script collections.
</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://smarden.org/runit/runscripts.html">Gerrit Pape made a collection of some run scripts some years ago.</a>
<a href="http://thedjbway.b0llix.net/services.html">Wayne Marshall has collected a few more.</a>
<a href="http://kdegraaf.net/supervise.html">So has Kevin J. DeGraaf.</a>
<a href="http://gluelogic.com/code/daemontools/examples.shtml">And so has Glenn Strauss.</a>
Simply take an appropriate <code>run</code> script, add minimal <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>restart</code> programs, put the lot into a <code>service</code> directory, put that into a bundle directory, and enable/start the service.
</p>

<p>
Minimal <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>restart</code> scripts are simply:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
true</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that Gerrit Pape's and Wayne Marshall's collections use shells as the script interpreters.
Several of the scripts can be simplified <em>yet further</em> with use of <code>nosh</code> and its built-in toolset.
One can replace uses of tools such as <code>chpst</code> and <code>tcpsvd</code> with the equivalent daemontools-alike tool(s) and some combination of <a href="commands/tcp-socket-listen.xml"><code>tcp-socket-listen</code></a>, <a href="commands/tcp-socket-accept.xml"><code>tcp-socket-accept</code></a>, and <a href="commands/ucspi-socket-rules-check.xml"><code>ucspi-socket-rules-check</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
However, it is not compulsory to change such <code>run</code> scripts if one has the various relevant tools available.
Service management places no restrictions upon how a <code>run</code> program is actually implemented.
<code>run</code> programs just need to be executable, and can after all be written in many ways: in Perl, as shell scripts, as <a href="commands/nosh.xml"><code>nosh</code></a> scripts, as <code>execlineb</code> scripts, in Python, or even in compiled languages.
</p>

<h2 id="convert-systemd-units">
You can import a systemd <em>service unit</em> file.
</h2>

<p>
<a href="converting-systemd-units.html">If the package comes with a systemd service unit file (and potentially an accompanying socket unit file), you can import it.</a>
Simply run <code>system-control convert-systemd-units <i>servicename</i></code> and the import utility will attempt to import the service and write a bundle directory.
(You can control where the bundle directory is written.)
This can cope with many systemd service units, as long as they aren't Linux-specific, esoteric, or too clever by half.
</p>

<p>
The import utility will display warnings about anything that it didn't understand or ignored.
</p>

<h2 id="writing">
You can simply write a bundle.
</h2>

<p>
As mentioned above, minimal <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>restart</code> scripts are very simple.
So, too, are <code>run</code> scripts.
</p>

<p>
The service interdependencies and orderings are usually quite simple, too:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>mkdir -p wants after before stopped-by wanted-by
ln -s /etc/service-bundles/targets/basic after/
ln -s /etc/service-bundles/targets/basic wants/
ln -s /etc/service-bundles/targets/shutdown before/
ln -s /etc/service-bundles/targets/shutdown stopped-by/
ln -s /etc/service-bundles/targets/workstation wanted-by/</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Tailor this according to need, of course.
</p>

<a href="working-from-rc-scripts.html">One can use old <code>rc</code> scripts as a <em>very</em> rough guide</a>.
