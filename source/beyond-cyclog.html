Beyond <code>cyclog</code>
</h1>

<p>
The logging services that are supplied out of the box with the package all use the supplied <a href="commands/cyclog.xml"><code>cyclog</code></a> tool.
</p>

<p>
It is not mandatory to use this, and other logging tools exist that can be easily substituted.
These include <a href="http://jdebp.eu./Softwares/djbwares/guide/commands/multilog.xml"><code>multilog</code></a>, <a href="http://untroubled.org/daemontools-encore/multilog.8.html"><code>multilog</code></a>, <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/svlogd.8.html"><code>svlogd</code></a>, and <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-log.html"><code>s6-log</code></a>.
These tools do more than <code>cyclog</code>, which is aimed at covering the most common use case, but by no means all possible use cases.
They can do filtering by pattern, compression at rotation time, general post-processing at rotation time (with saved state between rotations), and single-line "status" files.
