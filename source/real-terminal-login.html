Real terminal login
</h1>

<p>
Operating systems provide a range of devices that are real terminals, or things pretending to be real terminals, attached via serial ports (and possibly modems).
This package contains tools for running and managing TUI login services on real terminals.
It also contains pre-written service bundles for such TUI login services.
</p>

<p>
Login on real terminals is done with <code>ttylogin</code> services, configured to use those devices.
They are always alias names for other services, that are in turn named after the serial-line "getty" programs that they employ (such as <code>getty</code>, <code>mgetty</code>, and <code>agetty</code>).
</p>

<p>
Such a TUI login service is a very simple service, which can be managed just like other ordinary services, started and stopped and enabled and disabled in the usual way.
There is one augmentation to ordinary service management: the <a href="commands/preset.xml"><code>preset</code></a> command uses the ordinary preset file mechanism, but can also <a href="ttys.html">read the <code>/etc/ttys</code> file</a>.

<li><p>
For FreeBSD, TrueOS, DragonFly BSD, and similar: the services are <code>ttylogin@ttyu0</code> through to <code>ttylogin@ttyuf</code>, matching the operating system's real terminal devices <code>/dev/ttyu0</code> to <code>/dev/ttyuf</code>.
These are aliases for <code>getty@ttyu0</code> through to <code>getty@ttyuf</code>.
</p><p>
These services invoke the FreeBSD <code>/usr/libexec/getty</code> program, with the <i>getty class</i> of <code>std.9600</code>.
The <code>run</code> script for such services is basically this (using <code>getty@ttyu1</code> as an example):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
setsid
/usr/libexec/getty std.9600 ttyu1</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>
For OpenBSD: the services are <code>ttylogin@tty00</code> through to <code>ttylogin@tty07</code> and <code>ttylogin@ttyU0</code> through to <code>ttylogin@ttyU3</code>, matching the operating system's real terminal devices <code>/dev/tty00</code> to <code>/dev/tty07</code> and <code>/dev/ttyU0</code> to <code>/dev/ttyU3</code>.
These are aliases for <code>getty@tty00</code> through to <code>getty@tty07</code> and <code>getty@ttyU0</code> through to <code>getty@ttyU3</code>.
</p><p>
These services invoke the OpenBSD <code>/usr/libexec/getty</code> program, with the <i>getty class</i> of <code>std.9600</code>.
The <code>run</code> script for such services is basically this (using <code>getty@tty03</code> as an example):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
setsid
/usr/libexec/getty std.9600 tty03</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>
For Linux: the services are <code>ttylogin@ttyS0</code> through to <code>ttylogin@ttyS3</code>, matching the operating system's real terminal devices <code>/dev/ttyS0</code> to <code>/dev/ttyS3</code>.
By default, these are aliases for <code>agetty@ttyS0</code> through to <code>agetty@ttyS3</code>.
But they can if one wishes instead be aliased to <code>mgetty@ttyS0</code> through to <code>mgetty@ttyS3</code>.
</p><p>
The first set of services invokes Wietse Venema's <code>agetty</code> program.
The <code>run</code> script for such services is basically this (using <code>agetty@ttyS2</code> as an example):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
setsid
agetty ttyS2</pre></blockquote>
</p><p>
The second set of services invokes Gert Doering's <code>mgetty</code> program.
The <code>run</code> script for such services is basically this (using <code>mgetty@ttyS0</code> as an example):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
mgetty ttyS0</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Note that Florian La Roche's <code>mingetty</code> program and Felix von Leitner's <code>fgetty</code> program are not suitable for use with real terminals attached to serial devices.
