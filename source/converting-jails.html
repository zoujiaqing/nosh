Importing jail configurations
</h1>

<p>
The native mechanism for this system is the service bundle.
Natively, <a href="jailing-services.html">jails are a combination of "jail" services and "jailed" services</a>.
The external configuration import subsystem converts both FreeBSD version 9 and PC-BSD Warden jails into native service bundles.
All services and targets are subject to the usual service preset mechanism.
</p>

<p>
FreeBSD 9 jails are specified with settings in <code>rc.conf</code> and become pairs of <code>v9-jail@</code><i>jailname</i> and <code>v9-jailed@</code><i>jailname</i> services.
All converted services, when enabled, are wanted by the <code>jails</code> target.
To enable the converted jails each jail and jailed service must have an explicit enable and the <code>jails</code> target enabled with <code>jails_enable="YES"</code> in <code>rc.conf</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that converted jails <em>always</em> start in parallel.
There is no notion of starting them sequentially.
The <code>jail_parallel_start</code> setting is ignored.
</p>

<p>
Warden jails are specified with directories in the jail directory (in turn specified by a setting in <code>warden.conf</code>) and become pairs of <code>warden-jail@</code><i>jailname</i> and <code>warden-jailed@</code><i>jailname</i> services.
All converted services, when enabled, are wanted by the <code>warden</code> target.
To enable the converted jails each jail must have an explicit enable and the <code>warden</code> target enabled with <code>warden_enable="YES"</code> in <code>rc.conf</code>.
</p>

<p>
If start and stop programs are not provided, conversion attempts to auto-detect the type of the jailed system (by detecting the files of various system management tools) and generate stop and start settings accordingly.
