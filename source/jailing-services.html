Jailing services
</h1>

<p>
Using FreeBSD jails involves two things, a service that creates/destroys a jail, and zero or more services that are then run in that jail.
<a href="converting-jails.html">The external configuration import subsystem converts jails</a> to this native form.

Jail services

<p>
Jail services are a simple exercise in the use of the BSD <code>jail</code> command.
The service's <code>start</code> program uses <code>jail&nbsp;-c</code> with its <code>persist</code> option to create a jail that keeps running even whilst it contains no processes.
The service is marked as "ready after run" and "remain", and has a no-op <code>run</code> program that does nothing but exit.
The service's <code>stop</code> program uses <code>jail&nbsp;-r</code> to remove the jail.
</p>

<p>
Thus a jail's lifetime is controlled by the start and stop of a service, which has no running process itself.
</p>

<p>
The various configuration settings for the <code>jail</code> command are exposed as service environment variables, accessible with the <a href="commands/rcctl.xml"><code>rcctl</code></a> or the <a href="commands/system-control.xml"><code>set-service-env</code></a> and <a href="commands/system-control.xml"><code>print-service-env</code></a> commands.

<p>
Services that run in a jail, jailed services, simply use the BSD <code>jexec</code> command in its chain-loading mode.
They use it to move the current process, the d&aelig;mon itself, into a jail created and destroyed by a jail service.
</p>

<p>
They have <code>wants/</code> and <code>after/</code> relationships to the jail service.
Because the jail service becomes ready after the jail is fully created, they do not run until there is a jail for them to switch themselves into; and starting them implicitly starts the service for the jail that they run in.
