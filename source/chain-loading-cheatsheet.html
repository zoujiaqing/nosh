Chain loading cheatsheet
</h1>

<p>
<code>run</code> scripts conventionally use simple tools, that chain load from one tool to the next, to set up a d&aelig;mon's process state.
There is quite a large toolset available for this.
These are just some of most widely used chain loading commands.
</p>

<p>
For exposition, each command here omits the trailing argument vector, which is the rest of the commands to chain to.
That is determined by the script as a whole.
In a script interpreted by <a href="commands/nosh.xml"><code>nosh</code></a> or <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">Laurent Bercot's <code>execlineb</code></a>, one could (for readability) place these commands on individual lines.
In a POSIX-conformant shell script, these would have to be all on a single logical line (possibly comprising multiple physical lines joined by backslashed newlines).
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<pre>setuidgid myservice-d</pre>
<p>
<a href="limiting-services.html#users">Drop privileges</a> and operate henceforth under the aegis of user account <code>myservice-d</code>, the (dedicated) user account for this service.
</p></li>

<li>
<pre>envuidgid myservice-d</pre>
<p>
Set up the environment with the ID information of user account <code>myservice-d</code>, the (dedicated) user account for this service.
</p></li>

<li>
<pre>setuidgid-fromenv</pre>
<p>
<a href="limiting-services.html#users">Drop privileges</a> and operate henceforth under the aegis of the user account whose ID information is given in the environment.
</p></li>

<li>
<pre>chdir dir</pre>
<p>
Change process working directory to <code>dir</code>.
</p></li>

<li>
<pre>envdir env/</pre>
<p>
Process the environment directory <code>env/</code>.
An environment directory with this this name, specifically, is compatible with the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> commands to <a href="commands/rcctl.xml"><code>rcctl</code></a>.
</p></li>

<li>
<pre>softlimit -o 2048</pre>
<p>
<a href="limiting-services.html#Unix-limits">Adjust the soft limit</a> on the number of open file descriptors (in each d&aelig;mon process of the service) to 2048.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<pre>fdredir -r 0 seed</pre>
<p>
Redirect standard input to read from an existing file named <code>seed</code>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<pre>jexec wibble</pre>
<p>
<a href="jailing-services.html#jailed">Switch to running in (BSD) jail</a> <code>wibble</code>, which (presumably) another service is maintaining with the <code>jail</code> command.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<pre>rtprio 1</pre>
<p>
Run with (BSD) realtime scheduling policy at priority 1.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<pre>chrt --batch 1</pre>
<p>
Run with (Linux) <code>SCHED_BATCH</code> scheduling policy at priority 1.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<pre>tcp-socket-listen --backlog 2 --combine4and6 "::0" smtp</pre>
<p>
Listen, with a backlog of two pending connections, to the SMTP Relay port on all IPv6 and (if the system supports it) IPv4 addresses.
The chained-to program receives the listening socket file descriptor at a well-known, fixed, position.
If it needs the systemd convention for this, use the <code>--systemd-compatibility</code> option.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<pre>tcp-socket-accept --connection-limit 16</pre>
<p>
Accept connections on a pre-supplied listening socket, limiting the number of concurrent active accepted connection service processes to 16.
Multiple chained-to programs are forked, here.
The convention is to use another script, such as <code>./service</code>, for the chained-to program.
This permits adjustment of the service command on the fly, without need for stopping and restarting the service itself.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<pre>ucspi-socket-rules-check</pre>
<p>
Apply a UCSPI-TCP/UCSPI-UNIX access control ruleset.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<pre>line-banner 'Hello there!'</pre>
<p>
Print <code>Hello there!</code> to standard output.
Some server programs, such as Bernstein's publicfile FTP server, expect their initial greetings message to be written out for them.
</p></li>

<li>
<pre>read-conf --oknofile /etc/defaults/wibble</pre>
<p>
Read the environment configuration file <code>/etc/defaults/wibble</code>, without aborting if it does not exist.
Such files are a compatibility measure for setups that used to use such configuration files with System 5 <code>rc</code>.
They are less preferable to daemontools-like environment directories; and such configuration mechanisms are gradually falling into desuetude anyway.
However, this tool is also useful outwith d&aelig;mon <code>run</code> scripts.
</p></li>
